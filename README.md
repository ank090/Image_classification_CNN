# Image_classification_CNN
Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules.  
In this case we need to classify the image given as 'Dog' or 'Cat'  

# Attributes:
Images of dogs and cats  
  
# Libraries used:  
1 tensorflow  
2 keras  
3 Ipython  
4 PIL  
5 numpy
  
CNN is trained on 'adam' optimizer with 'binary_crossentropy' as loss function over 20 epochs.
